# Download To Go
Download-to-Go (DTG) framework for iOS. 

Used to download Kaltura HLS streams for offline playback. 

## Documentation
Please see our [documentation](https://kaltura.github.io/playkit-dtg-ios) for usage and info.

## M3U8Kit
DTG uses an external HLS parser, M3U8Kit. Currently there's a bug in the latest version of this library. As a workaround, the app needs to 
directly point to Kaltura's fork of the pod:
    
    pod 'M3U8Kit', :git => 'https://github.com/kaltura/M3U8Paser', :tag => 'k0.2.2'
